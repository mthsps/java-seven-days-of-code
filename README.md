## Daily Tasks

**Day 1**: Consume the IMDB API, fetch the top 250 movies from their list and print the corresponding JSON in the console.

**Day 2**: Parse the JSON response obtained from IMDB to extract its information and attributes (like title, poster, note, etc).

**Day 3**: Create a 'Movie' structure with some attributes, with the intention that each object of this type encapsulates its own data.

**Day 4**: Generate an HTML page from the list of objects obtained earlier. 

**Day 5**: Encapsulate some of the calls developed in new classes.

**Day 6**: Use interfaces to make code more generic.

**Day 7**: Sort the list of movies based on different attributes, using the Collections class and the Comparable and Comparator interfaces.
